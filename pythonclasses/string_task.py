varma = '''After RRR, Jr NTR's next is the big thing with sky-high expectations. 
The actor announced two films – NTR 30 with Kortala Siva and NTR 31 with Prashanth Neel.
However, except for an official announcement, no major updates about the film have been 
announced and fans have been waiting with bated breath asking makers for updates.

In December, Pinkvilla exclusively reported an update about the highly anticipated
NTR30 “NTR has been very cautious with what he wants to do following the global fame 
that RRR has got him. He has been working closely with Kortala Siva on the script of 
NTR 30 and is finally satisfied with the output of the final draft. The film Mahurat 
is expected to take place in Hyderabad by Mid-January and the full-fledged shoot will 
start from February 2023,” revealed a source close to the development.'''
